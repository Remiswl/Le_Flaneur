# Le Flaneur/The Stroller - Tours generator

## Introduction
Welcome to Le Fl√¢neur's website that will allow you to discover a city through two options:
* generate a trip based on a departure and an arrival address. The site will generate trips so that you can visit a maximum of points of interest
* either display the points of interest around your address or in your city

These two main functions are freely accessible.

However, once registered, the user will be able to:
* manage his data (add, modify, delete)
* submit points of interest
* consult his trip history
* delete his account

Finally, only administrators have access to the admin page, and will be able to:
* consult the website's statistics
* view the messages send from the 'Contact us' page
* edit and delete points of interest
* manage categories (modification / deletion)
* manage user rights (visitor / admin)
* delete a user

The site was made to end my training in 3W Academy and get my Certification as Web developper.
